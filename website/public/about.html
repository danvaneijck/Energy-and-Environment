                <h3>History</h3>
                <p>Energy and Environment was published for more than 15 years as part of the Trans-Tasman stable of publications founded by Ian Templeton. This was taken over by Max Bowden and unfortunately the company was placed in liquidation in 2017 and wound up.
                    <br><br>In 2018, Energy and Environment was purchased from those who had taken over the distressed assets and now operates as a separate publication. Trans-Tasman is still published by Tony Doe who can be contacted at tdoe@transtasman.co.nz.
                    <br><br> Energy and Environment is now written by a group of people, some of whom used to work for the former Trans-Tasman publication. It also has additional contributors all with experience and in-depth knowledge of the sectors they cover.
                    <br><br>Energy and Environment is published by Calcamrya Ltd and edited and curated by Ian Llewellyn.
